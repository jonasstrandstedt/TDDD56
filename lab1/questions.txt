1. The black pixels takes longer to compute due to reaching max iterations. If one chunk has lots of pixels reaching max iterations makes it slower than others.

2. Split the image in more blocks/chunks than there are threads, if the blocks are distributed venly the heavy chunks will be distributed to more threads.
